# Rationale

The luteal (pre-menstrual) phase of the menstrual cycle is often associated with negative emotional, physical, and behavioral changes.[^1] While the pre-menstrual symptoms of most menstruators do not impair daily life, nor reach the severity required for clinical diagnosis,[^2] they can still affect one’s quality of life. For example, in a survey of 32,748 menstruators in The Netherlands, menstrual symptoms have resulted in large losses in productivity.[^3]

However, _most menstruators are not aware of these influences_, which makes them vulnerable to _self-criticism over their lost productivity_. This could potentially create a feedback loop where menstruators overexert themselves to make up for lost productivity, which exacerbates their menstrual symptoms, and the cycle repeats.

Additionally, most period-tracking apps in the market focus on the relationship between _menstrual symptoms_ and only _one_ lifestyle factor, such as productivity, exercise, diet, or sleep, thus failing to provide a holistic view of the bidirectional relationships between their lifestyle factors and menstrual symptoms.

As such, the need exists for an app that _encourages sustainable productivity in menstruators_ by:

1. **Aggregating sleep and exercise data**—securely and automatically—from other health apps on the user’s device wherever possible
2. **Visualizing the bidirectional relationships** between their wearable data, menstrual symptoms, and productivity to increase awareness about how their lifestyle affects their menstrual cycle
3. **Encouraging them to exercise self-compassion and self-care**, especially when healthy baselines are breached and/or menstrual symptoms are particularly intense, through the use of in-app messages as well as app notifications
